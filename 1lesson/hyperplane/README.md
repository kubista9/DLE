# Simple Hyperplane Visualization

## verview

This script demonstrates the concept of a hyperplane as a decision boundary for classifying data points into two different classes. It uses Python and matplotlib to generate a simple dataset and visualize how a hyperplane separates two groups.

## How It Works

1. **Generate synthetic data**:
    - Create two classes of data points using numpy.

2. **Define the hyperplane**:

    - Use a simple linear equation  as the decision boundary.

3. **Plot the dataset**:

Visualize the two classes and the hyperplane.

## Expected Output

A scatter plot showing:

ðŸ”µ Blue points representing Class 1.

ðŸ”´ Red points representing Class 2.

âš« Dashed black line (the hyperplane) separating the two classes.


```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib
